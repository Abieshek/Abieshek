### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Abieshek and I am a Software Developer from Atlanta, GA. I graduated from Georgia Institute of Technology with a BS in Computer Science in May of 2022 and have been since working as a Software Developer.

ðŸ”­ I have experience with Java enterprise applications in the Spring Framework and using ORMs, and REST APIs to connect with the frontend and backend. Check out Soil2Plate related projects in my repos! I have experience developing Java domain classes based on business requirements, implementing Spring Data (JPA, JDBC, and Hibernate) to connect Java objects to SQL backend data, implementing a service layer to handle business logic, creating a REST controller with REST APIs to allow frontend frameworks to interface with Java and therby access/modify database instances and creating Angular frontend applications that connect to the REST APIs to perform functionalitys like logging in with user data. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to make cool animations and style websites in Angular. Check out my CandidateWebsite to see some of my progress/examples.
